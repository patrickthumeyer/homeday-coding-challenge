# Github user fetching

## Instructions

### Create an app that allows users to search for a Github user and see some information about them. It should consist of two views:

#### The form view:

The user should be able to type a username.
The input should have validation (No empty values allowed).
The user should be able to submit the form.

#### The results view:

It should show some information about the searched user (image, first name and last name as a minimum).

### Bonus

The route of the results page contains the username which allows the user to access the results page directly if they have the username (e.g. /results/homeday-de)
Semantic HTML is used
Error handling

### Additional info

To fetch a Github user you can use this endpoint: https://developer.github.com/v3/users/#get-a-single-user

### General guidelines

Use any framework, library or API you like
The code should be readable and clearly commented when needed
The project should be pushed to a public github repository
README.md should contain project documentation (how to run and build the project locally from scratch, project structure, gotchas,... anything worth mentioning)
The UI should be responsive

### Evaluation Criteria

UX / UI: Does the app look and feel good?
Code Quality: Is the code clean, consistent, well-structured and easy to understand?
